# Pulse-and-Wave-Generator
1. **0.1 Sec Pulse with LM741:** Design a monostable circuit using the LM741 operational amplifier to generate a 0.1-second pulse. The circuit is triggered by an input signal, and the LM741, configured in a monostable mode, produces a single pulse of 0.1-second duration.

2. **0.1 Sec Pulse with 555 Timer:** Use a 555 timer IC to create a monostable circuit that generates a 0.1-second pulse upon triggering. The circuit is configured so that the 555 timer produces a precise pulse width of 0.1 seconds, based on external resistors and capacitors.

3. **1 kHz Square Wave with LM741:** Design an astable multivibrator circuit using the LM741 operational amplifier to generate a 1 kHz square wave. The LM741 is configured to oscillate at a frequency of 1 kHz, producing a continuous square wave signal.

4. **1 kHz Square Wave with 555 Timer:** Create an astable multivibrator circuit using a 555 timer IC to generate a 1 kHz square wave with a 60% duty cycle. The 555 timer, with specific resistor and capacitor values, produces a 1 kHz frequency signal with the desired duty cycle.
