# Pulse-and-Wave-Generator
The project includes four tasks: 1) Using the LM741 op-amp in a monostable circuit to generate a 0.1-second pulse. 2) Designing a similar 0.1-second pulse with a 555 timer. 3) Creating a 1 kHz square wave using an astable LM741 circuit. 4) Generating a 1 kHz square wave with a 60% duty cycle using a 555 timer.
